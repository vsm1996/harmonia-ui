2. Open the Capacity Controls panel
3. Show the UI in its default "Focused" state
4. Drag the cognitive slider down to show "Minimal" mode
5. Show the UI simplifying (fewer guests, shorter text, calmer UI)
6. Drag cognitive and emotional up to show "Exploratory" mode
7. Show the expressive animations and full content
